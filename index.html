                <h1>Investigating Trends in <i>The New York Times</i> Through Visualization</h1>
                <h2>By Ethan Brooks and Tamur Asar</h2>
                <p>The following visualizations were constructed using a collection
                    of over <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryansingh0909/nyt-articles-21m-2000-present"
                        target="_blank">two million New York Times articles</a>. They aim to illustrate common patterns,
                    be that cultural or semantic, that exist in NYT articles. While we do not have comprehensive datasets
                    for other news agencies to compare to, we aim to extrapolate our findings as an explanation to broader
                    news trends.

                <h2>Which New York Times sections produce the most news?</h2>
                <!-- Year Selector -->
                <div class="year-selector">
                    <label for="year">Select Year:</label>
                    <select id="year"></select>

                    This visualization, called a Treemap, shows the breakdown
                    of published articles by section for a given year. Treemaps
                    are effective at conveying how individual sections contribute to the total volume of published articles. By
                    interacting with the year selector, users can explore trends over time. For example, they might discover
                    growth in technology-related articles with the rise of the internet and digital culture. They might also
                    discover the New York section was common during the post-9/11 period, that the Business Day section rose
                    during the 2007 financial crisis, and that the World section rose during the 2003 Iraq War. Viewers may also
                    notice that some sections hold a relatively constant percentage makeup of total articles published, while
                    others fluctuate greatly year to year.

                <h2>What were the most common words of each year?</h2>
                <!-- Year Selector -->
                <div class="year-selector">
                    <label for="wordcloud-year">Select Year:</label>
                    <select id="wordcloud-year"></select>
                </div>
                <!-- Word Cloud Container -->

                <p>
                    "Hot topic" words can give us insights into the current events
                    of a given year. This word cloud shows for each year the top ten keywords that saw the largest percentage
                    increase in frequency of use from the previous year. We decided on a word cloud because it allows users to
                    visualize the growth of top keywords and compare them relative to others. The size of each word indicates the
                    magnitude of growth, making it easy to identify which topics have gained the most traction. As one might
                    expect, in 2001, the keywords 'New York City' and 'Terrorism' grew significantly from the previous year,
                    reflecting the impact of the September 11th attacks on public consciousness and media coverage. In 2003, we
                    see the prominence of keywords like 'Iraq', 'United States International Relations', and 'Housing',
                    coinciding with the Iraq War and the focus on real estate that foreshadowed the coming housing market crisis.
                    In 2008, 'Barack Obama' and 'United States Economy' surge in frequency, corresponding to Obama's election
                    campaign and the global financial crisis.

                <h2>Current events shape our news landscape - How do topical news events shift the tone of articles across

                    This line chart illustrates the
                    average sentiment across various sections over time. We utilized sentiment analysis to gauge the emotional
                    tone of the articles in each section, presenting a clear picture of how the tone of news changes.
                    This visualization shows how different sections of news might respond to the same event. For example, the
                    September 11 attacks in 2001 and the financial crisis of 2008 led to significant shifts in sentiment across all
                    sections, highlighting how major events have a widespread impact on reporting.

                    Here, we find the breakdown of tone for different sections, allowing for a straightforward comparative
                    analysis. Immediately you can recognize a trend in some of the bars. Perhaps most insightful is the category
                    for "World". Between 2000 and 2010, the category for World never has an overall negative sentiment quantifier
                    under fifty percent. That means, year over year, over fifty percent of world news articles published by The New
                    York Times focus on negative subjects. We can contrast this to a category such as "Travel" where the category
                    is overwhelmingly positive. This makes sense: travel news typically emphasizes the beauty of the world. In
                    contrast, the most commonly talked about world news subjects are international conflicts. At the time of
                    writing, opening The New York Times's World News page greets us with the Israel-Palestine conflict and the
                    Russia-Ukraine War. There are no positive world articles. Is that to say there is no positive world news? Or
                    that The New York Times provides what consumers seek, and people are looking for news about conflicts rather
                    than their resolutions.

                    Our visualizations have provided valuable
                    insights into the publishing trends, keyword growth, and sentiment dynamics of New York Times articles over
                    the years. By exploring the data through these visualizations, we can better understand how The New York
                    Times has responded to historical events, how public interests have shifted, and how the tone of news
                    reporting has evolved. We hope these visualizations inspire further exploration and analysis of media
                    trends, contributing to a deeper understanding of the factors that shape the news landscape.
